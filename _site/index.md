# Flim Nite

FLIM (noun): a distorted adaptation of a popular film performed live by comedians, theatremakers, poets, writers, musicians, dancers and artists

FLIM NITE is an experimental performance event based around the unfaithful retelling of popular films.

We’ve been creating distorted adaptations of classic movies for four years in the North of England, joined by a vast troupe of guest artists from across the UK.

Our regular events take place in Manchester, Newcastle and Sheffield, with special events all over the place.

“The group take a hammer to well-known films and smash them into something completely different – think a smorgasbord of musical interludes, a dab of poetry and an added bit of standup comedy. Trust us, it’s unlike any other night around!” - The Skinny
