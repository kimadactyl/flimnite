<div class="lede">FLIM (noun): a distorted adaptation of a popular film performed live by comedians, theatremakers, poets, writers, musicians, dancers and artists</div>

**FLIM NITE is an experimental performance event based around the unfaithful retelling of popular films.**

We’ve been creating distorted adaptations of classic movies for four years in the North of England, joined by a vast troupe of guest artists from across the UK.

Our regular events take place in Manchester, Newcastle and Sheffield, with special events all over the place.

> “The group take a hammer to well-known films and smash them into something completely different – think a smorgasbord of musical interludes, a dab of poetry and an added bit of standup comedy. Trust us, it’s unlike any other night around!”
